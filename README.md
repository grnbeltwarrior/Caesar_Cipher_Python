# Caesar_Cipher_Python

* The script doesn't work, some issues with the wrap. Learning is occuring on how to simpliy the logic I believed was well enough.

Reading more about cracking codes with python. Using the following book: Cracking Codes With Python. Decided to try my hand at doing a caeser cipher without reading the chapter. Also spent time figuring out how to use optparse to do some switches to encrypt or not, key shift, and the message.

It's not perfect but it's what I was able to come up with during the evening of relaxing after the first day of Derbycon 8.0
